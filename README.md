# basic_python
This repository contains a basic python setup.

## Setup Pycharm
- Make sure to set the correct git username before committing to the repository.
For this, add the following lines to projectfolder/.git/config  
    [user]  
    name = myuser  
    email = mymail@xxx.com


- As a package manager, we use pipenv (pip install pipenv).

## Coding conventions
### Naming
- We use the camel case notation in all situations.

## Testing
- We use the python unittest package to write unittests. For every file, we create a new testing file. The filename, the testing class and all testcases have 'test' as name prefixes.
