# basic_python
This repository contains a basic python setup.

## Setup
Make sure to set the correct git username before committing to the repository.

As a package manager, we use pipenv (pip install pipenv).

## Coding conventions
### Naming
We use the camel case notation in all situations.

## Testing
We use the python unittest package to write unittests.
For every file, we create a new testing file.
The filename, the testing class and all testcases have 'test' as name prefixes.
